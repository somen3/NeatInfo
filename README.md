# NeatInfo

You can run the conky theme with conky manager app. To use the conky theme, simply extract the file, and place the folder inside your ~/user/.conky/ directory. 

NeatInfo lets you add your Todos to the conky, and to have your todos displayed in the conky, all you have to do is create a file, todo.txt in your ~/Documents. You can add your todos to the todo.txt, and it will display in your conky.
