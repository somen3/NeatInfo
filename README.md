You can run the Conky theme with the Conky Manager app. To use the Conky theme, simply extract the file and place it inside your ~/user/.conky/ directory. 

NeatInfo lets you add your notes and todos to the Conky. To display your notes and todos in the Conky, you simply have to create a file, note.txt, in your ~/Documents. Once you create this file, you can add your notes and todos to the text file to have them displayed in your Conky.
